## What is a machine learning?
In simple terms, machine learning is a diverse set of tools that are used to understand data and it allows us to go further beyond summary statistics and basic analystics. To sum it up, machine learning learns from the data without being programmed. 

## MLib
Databrick users are able to access the MLlib, or Spark's machine learning library, which makes machine learning scalabe and easy to implement . Tools avaiable for the library include

-ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering

-Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection

-Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines

-Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines

-Utilities: linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.

## Two Type of MLib
